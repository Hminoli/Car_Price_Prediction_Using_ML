# üöó Used Car Price Prediction ‚Äì Machine Learning Project

---

## Introduction

Buying or selling a used car can be complex without a clear understanding of its fair market price. This project aims to predict the prices of used cars using various features. 

---

##   Data

- **Dataset:** `used_cars.csv`  
- **Source:** Kaggle
- **Features Include:**
  - Brand/Model
  - Year of manufacture
  - Engine size
  - Kilometers driven
  - Fuel type
  - Transmission
  - Color
  - Owner Count
  - Service History
  - Accidents Reported
  - Insurance Valid
  - Price (target)

---

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Exploratory Data Analysis was performed to understand the structure and relationships within the dataset. This included:

- Descriptive statistics (mean, median, mode)
- Distribution plots (histograms)
- Correlation analysis between features and the target variable `price_usd`
- There is no evidence of multicollinearity

### Correlation Check

- A correlation matrix was computed to identify which features had strong or weak relationships with `price_usd`

- The feature **`accidents_reported`** had a **very low correlation** with the target variable `price_usd`. The  column was **dropped** from the dataset.

## Data Preprocessing

Key preprocessing steps performed:
- Handled missing 
- No duplicates values
- Converted categorical features using  one-hot encoding
- Handled outliers and extreme values

## Model Building

Several machine learning models used :
- Linear Regression
- Random Forest Regressor
- Support Vector Machine
- KNN

**Model evaluation metrics:**
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- R¬≤ Score

---

## Feature Selection
- Used forward feature selection to pick the best features for the model.

---

## Results
- There is no evidence of multicollinearity
- Linear Regression achieved the highest accuracy
- Selected features and their coefficients in the final model (R squard = 0.871626):

Intercept: -297,152.98

engine_cc: 1.50

make_year: 149.28

owner_count: -499.56

fuel_type_Electric: 2,989.68

mileage_kmpl: 122.38

brand_Tesla: -105.34

## Conclusion

-Forward feature selection helped identify the most important features 
impacting the price.

-The final model is a Linear Regression using these key features: engine size, manufacturing year, owner count, fuel_type_Electric, mileage, and brand_Tesla .
